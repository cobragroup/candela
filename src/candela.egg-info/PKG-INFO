# Cobra Anomaly Detection Library

<img align="left" margin-right="30px" src="candela.png" alt="logo TACR" height="73px"></a>The Cobra ANomaly DEtection LibrAry (candela) is a toolbox for the detection and analysis of anomalies and outliers in a wide range of data types, implemented in Python.
Its modular architecture makes it easily adaptable to the needs of various application areas. The toolbox has a modular structure that allows the extension of its functionalities. The outlier detection techniques based on machine learning, which are included in the current version of the software, are based on the Scikit-learn library (Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830, 2011).

We present several different instruments for the analysis of different types of anomalies in the data, from easy statistical approaches to more advanced machine-learning techniques. We show the example of use on single features together with the example of useful feature selection, such as the detection of speed and/or angular anomalies in a trajectory. Further, the more complex multivariate feature analysis is presented, which might be beneficial, for example, in the case of too-short trajectories, where usual trajectory detection is problematic. Also, the proposed set of tools might be used for further data analysis, such as the identification of the most informative feature, or distribution of outliers in space and/or time.

Future versions will include further modules, as well as additional parameter options for existing modules.
